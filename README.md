It can be formed by either Brandenburg, Saxony or Bohemia when the competitors have been eliminated or vassalized and enough provinces in north-eastern Germany have been conquered.

Forming the Elbian Confederation will integrate the other contenders if they are weak enough.

The missions the Elbian Confederation has access to are focused on the conquest and incorporation of the North-Germany region.

The Elbian missions are a modified more powerful version of the Bohemian ideas.
