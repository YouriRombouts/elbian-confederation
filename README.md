# elbian-confederation
EU4 mod that adds the Elbian Confederation to the game as a formable nation

The Elbian Confederation is a formable nation from the Victoria II mod Divergences of Darkness.
It can be formed by either Brandenburg, Saxony or Bohemia when the competitors have been eliminated or vassalized and enough provinces in north-eastern Germany have been conquered.
The missions the Elbian Confederation has access to are focused on the conquest and incorporation of the North-Germany region.
The Elbian missions are a modified more powerful version of the Bohemian ideas.
